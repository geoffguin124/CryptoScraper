# CryptoScraper
Utilizes python requests and bs4 libraries to scrape information about cryptocurrencies and sends an update to discord when a coin has changed price.

Plans for this project include:
- Coin choosing
- Price range alerts
- Customizing webhooks
- Hosting project
- Eventually adding "advice" algorithms to buy/sell at a given time.
